## Acceptance Criteria Template

For each user story, we should define:
1. **Given** (initial context)
2. **When** (action taken)
3. **Then** (expected outcome)
4. **And** (additional conditions)

Example:
```
Story: As a teacher, I want to create a new classroom session

Given I am logged in as a teacher
When I navigate to the session creation page
And I fill out the session form with valid information
And I click "Create Session"
Then a new session should be created
And I should be redirected to the session detail page
And 20 students should be automatically generated
And I should see a success message
```

This format ensures each story has clear, testable requirements that can guide development and quality assurance.
