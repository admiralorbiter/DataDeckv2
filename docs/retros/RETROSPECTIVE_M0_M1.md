## Retrospective — M0 (Bootstrap & Tooling) and M1 (Data Model & Seed)

Date: December 2024

**Status**: M0, M1, M2, and M3 complete. Session management, admin user creation, module system, and comprehensive testing implemented. Ready for M4.

### Executive summary

- **M0/M1 are complete and solid**: App factory, blueprints, CSRF, auth scaffolding, and core models are implemented. Seed script, observer flow, and admin dashboard exist with full CRUD operations.
- **Major fixes completed**: Session uniqueness enforcement with hybrid auto-archive, admin user creation with proper school/district handling, unified login documentation, admin-configurable Module system implementation.
- **Ready for M4**: Core infrastructure is stable, tested, and documented. Session creation flow, admin module management, and comprehensive test suite are fully functional.

### M0 — Bootstrap & Tooling

- **What’s good**
  - `create_app` initializes `db`, `LoginManager`, `CSRF`, sets `login_view` to `auth.login` (`app.py`).
  - Blueprints registered centrally via `routes/__init__.py`; helper `create_blueprint` in `routes/base.py` keeps modules minimal.
  - CSRF enabled globally; disabled in tests via `TestingConfig`.
  - `.env` support via `python-dotenv` early in bootstrap.
  - Basic developer ergonomics via `Makefile` and `requirements.txt`.

- **Remaining gaps**
  - **Migrations**: Using `db.create_all()` by design (no Alembic per user preference). Schema changes handled manually.
  - **Config safety**: Default `SECRET_KEY` is dev-safe only. Production should provide strong secret via env var.
  - **Testing DB**: File-based SQLite works on Windows; in-memory option available if needed.
  - **Logging**: Basic Flask logging sufficient for current phase. Structured logging planned for M11.

- **Future opportunities**
  - Friendly error handlers for 400/401/403/404/500 with JSON/HTML parity (planned M11).
  - Cookie settings for prod (Secure, HttpOnly, SameSite) and optional remember-me toggle.
  - CI workflow (lint + tests + coverage) as documented in README but not yet present.

### M1 — Data Model & Seed

- **What’s good**
  - Models implemented: `User` (+roles), `Observer` and `Student` via joined-table inheritance; `District`, `School`, `Session`, `Media`, `Comment`, `StudentMediaInteraction`.
  - Useful role helpers (`is_admin`, etc.), `requires_school_info()` and `validate()` enforcing teacher/observer school/district presence.
  - Indexes and constraints present for common access patterns (e.g., media/session, student-media unique interaction).
  - Seed script creates a realistic dev baseline: district, school, teacher, session, N students with hashed pins.

- **Recent fixes completed**
  - ✅ **Session uniqueness**: Implemented hybrid approach with `SessionService` - detects conflicts, offers auto-archive option, enforces one active session per (teacher, section).
  - ✅ **Admin-configurable modules**: Replaced hardcoded enum with database-driven Module model, allowing admins to create/manage curriculum modules dynamically.
  - ✅ **Admin user creation**: Fixed school/district ID coercion, added form fields with show/hide logic, proper validation for teachers/observers.
  - ✅ **Session creation flow**: Full session creation with student generation, conflict resolution UI, archive/unarchive functionality.
  - **Students**: `User.password_hash` used as PIN hash for students; auth is session-only (PIN-based), not email+password.

- **Minor remaining items**
  - `Media.submitted_password` field exists but usage unclear; likely legacy. Can document or remove later.

- **Future opportunities**
  - Add `__repr__` for `User`, `Session`, etc. to improve debugging/logs.
  - Denormalized `User.school`/`User.district` names are pragmatic now but can drift; plan a post-MVP strategy (sync or removal).

### Auth, routes, and templates

- **What’s good**
  - Unified `/login` handles email-first then username; observer session via `session["observer_id"]`; others via Flask-Login.
  - `/logout` clears both observer session and Flask-Login; redirects match expectations.
  - Observer dashboard enforces district isolation; school view lists teachers in-district.
  - Admin dashboard lists users and provides create/edit/delete (create/delete gated to admin).
  - Profile route supports password changes by role template.

- **Recent fixes completed**
  - ✅ **Docs alignment**: Updated `docs/ACCOUNTS.md`, `docs/FLASK_REWRITE_PLAN.md`, `docs/WBS.md`, and `README.md` to reflect unified login and remove Alembic references.
  - ✅ **Session routes**: Added full sessions blueprint with start, list, detail, archive/unarchive routes and templates.
  - ✅ **Navigation**: Added Sessions link to navbar for teachers/admins.

- **Authorization clarity**
  - Staff can view admin dashboard; only admins can create/delete users. Policy documented in code and tests.

### Testing and developer experience

- **What's good**
  - Tests cover model uniqueness/relationships, observer auth, admin flows, profile password change, and a student-only route.
  - CSRF disabled for tests; fixtures handle schema lifecycle.
  - ✅ **New comprehensive tests**: Added `test_session_service.py` (8 tests) and `test_admin_user_creation.py` (5 tests) covering new functionality.

- **Status**
  - ✅ **Windows testing**: Test runner working properly with good output. All tests passing.
  - **CI workflow**: Planned but not yet implemented. Pre-commit hooks working locally.

### Security

- **Strengths**
  - Passwords and pins hashed with `werkzeug.security`.
  - CSRF protection globally enabled.

- **Fixes**
  - Enforce production `SECRET_KEY` and DB URI at startup.
  - Set secure cookie flags for production.

### Pre‑M3 readiness checklist (COMPLETED)

- [x] **Implement session uniqueness validation** for (created_by_id, section) when `is_archived=False` with user-friendly error.
- [x] **Define `module` semantics** (Enum + form validation + help text).
- [x] **Fix admin edit coercion** for `school_id`/`district_id` (blank→None, else `int`).
- [x] **Align `docs/ACCOUNTS.md`** to unified login and clarify observer flow.
- [x] **Add note on student PIN hashing** and session-only student auth to docs.
- [x] **Windows testing reliability** confirmed working properly.
- [x] **Remove Alembic references** from all docs (using `db.create_all()` by design).
- [ ] **Add CI** (lint + tests + coverage threshold) - planned for later.
- [ ] **Decide fate of `Media.submitted_password`** (document or remove) - minor cleanup item.

### Additional accomplishments

- [x] **Full session management** - Create, list, detail, archive/unarchive with conflict resolution
- [x] **Student generation service** - 20 students per session with unique names/PINs and character themes
- [x] **Session service architecture** - Clean separation of business logic with comprehensive testing
- [x] **Enhanced admin UI** - Dynamic form fields, better validation, improved UX
- [x] **Navigation integration** - Sessions accessible from main nav for appropriate roles
- [x] **Module system redesign** - Converted from hardcoded enum to admin-configurable database model
- [x] **Module admin UI** - Full CRUD operations for modules in admin dashboard with validation
- [x] **Dynamic form choices** - Session creation form populates module choices from active modules
- [x] **Default module seeding** - Three default modules created: Module 2, Module 4, and Any Data Project
- [x] **Observer authentication unification** - Moved observers from separate session system to unified Flask-Login authentication, enabling profile access and password changes
- [x] **Pure normalization implementation** - Removed denormalized school/district string fields, implemented clean foreign key relationships with automatic school/district creation

### Questions resolved

- ✅ **Session duplicates**: Implemented hybrid approach - user gets friendly error with option to auto-archive existing session.
- ✅ **Module system**: Implemented admin-configurable database model with default modules (Module 2, Module 4, Any Data Project) and full CRUD operations.
- ✅ **Student auth**: Confirmed PIN-only auth with session-based access (no Flask-Login for students).
- ✅ **Staff vs admin**: Staff can view admin dashboard, only admins can create/delete users (tested and documented).
- ✅ **Windows dev target**: Confirmed Windows as primary dev platform, testing works properly.

### Open questions for future consideration

- **Observer profile**: ✅ **RESOLVED** - Observers now use unified Flask-Login authentication and can access the profile page to change passwords.
- **Denormalized names**: ✅ **RESOLVED** - Implemented pure normalization. Removed denormalized school/district strings, using only foreign key relationships with clean template access.
- **Student PIN reset**: Always teacher-regenerated or add self-service option?

### Environment note (Windows test runner)

- Activate venv and install:
  - PowerShell: `python -m venv .venv; .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1; pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Prefer in-memory DB for tests: set `TestingConfig.SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI = "sqlite:///:memory:"`.
- Run tests: `pytest -q -rA -s`.
